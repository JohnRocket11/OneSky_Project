# OneSky_Project

SCOPE OF THE PROBLEM
There are a few problems that OneSky wants to be addressed to help them decide what investments should be made for their company. First, they want an analysis on differences in travel patterns between Vertical Takeoff and Landing (VTOL) and private jets. Second, they want an analysis on predicted hotspots for VTOLs and EVTOLs in the future years. After both of these problems are addressed, it will lead to suggested investments, which can be made in infrastructure such as buying aircrafts, heliports, and EV parking garages. 
	
BACKGROUND
OneSky is a company that supplies technological support to private aviation companies that are comprised and known as Directional. The companies apart of Directional are: FlexJet, Sentient Jet, FXAIR, PrivateFly, AAG, Halo Aviation, and Sirio, which are located in USA and Europe. Some of the companies own private jets, while the others own helicopters, also known as VTOLs. In the future AGG and Halo Aviation want to get into the EVTOL industry. An EVTOL is an electric autonomous vehicle which allows for travel like a car, but in the sky from one location to another. OneSky recently bought 200 EVTOLs from Embraer that will be completed in 2026, meaning that the hotspots found must be prepared for the incoming EVTOLs in the next five years. 

RESEARCH METHODOLOGY 
Several sources were used for the data analysis of this project. First, data was provided from OneSky on FlexJet’s small and light private jets travel from 2017-2021. This data was beneficial for finding top flight patterns for future VTOL and EVTOL travel.  The book “1984 AIA Directory of Heliports & Helistops” written by the Aerospace Industries Association of America, was used to analyze the growth of Heliports on a state-by-state basis. This was beneficial to see that the predicted number of Heliports in a state was more than the actual amount operational to this day. The data on the current number of FAA approved and operational Heliports was taken off the website City-Data. Heliports were analyzed for VTOLs, while EV Charging Stations was looked at for EVTOL. Data on EV Charging Stations throughout the years was taken off Shahan’s article, “EV Charging Station Installations Increasing Fast In USA - 245 in 2009 to 20,000+ in 2019”, which had the number of stations from 2014-2020. Then to analyze the exact locations of the EV Charging Stations that were considered as garages or parking lots, since that is where the EVTOLs would land, the Department of Energy’s data was used off their website.

TRAVEL PATTERNS
Finding the differences in travel patterns is important for this project because it allows for future flight routes for VTOL and EVTOL travel to be predicted. The data from OneSky has shown there can be a difference between VTOL and private jet travel. The number of flights between 2017-2021 that were 30 minutes or less was less than 1,000 flights, while the total number of flights any duration during that time period was close to 37,000 flights. In 2020-2021 there were around 9,000 flights records, as you can see in Figure 1:

Figure 1

This shows that many private jet flights occurred around the USA throughout 2020-2021, but some of them had travel patterns throughout the years that are not visible through Figure 1. A further analysis was done as seen in Figure 2 and 3 to look at flight patterns and the busiest airports: 
 
Figure 2

Figure 3

From this, it can be concluded that there is a correlation between the number times that an airport is used, and the user’s go to flight route. Figure 2 shows the top flight routes distances; they are mostly long range, which is expected for private jets unlike a VTOL and EVTOL in the future. Figure 3 show that the private jet users have preferred airports that they use that are likely around where they live.
The data used above was then filtered to flights only 30 minutes or less and the years 2017-2019 were added for more data points. As seen in Figure 4, it is much easier to distinguish flight patterns:
 
Figure 4

Most of the flights in Figure 4 can be replace by future VTOL and EVTOL travel once they are setup. To have a more in-depth analysis on travel patterns to top flight routes, arrival airports, and departure airports, they are listed in Figures 5 and 6:
 
Figure 5

Figure 6

The big thing to take away from these charts are that the distances between the most traveled flights in Figure 5 are all close to or below 100 miles meaning that they can be replaced by VTOL and EVTOL travel. Since the data points that comprised data from 2017-2021 for flights 30 minutes or less was less than 3% of all the flight travel data in 2017-2021, it means there is data that proves there is a difference between private jet and VTOL travel. 

HOTSPOTS
The data on Heliports and EV Charging Stations can help to show where possible hotspots for the EVTOL and VTOL industries could takeoff. As seen in figure 7, the EV Chargers and Heliports were plotted on a map to see if there was a correlation between the two:
 
Figure 7

It can be concluded that there are some possible hotspots on the east and west coasts of the map for EV charging stations and Heliports. Keep in mind the data for EV chagrining stations were filtered to only ones considered as parking lots and garages since that is were EVTOLs would be able to land. It was then looked at for the growth of EV charging stations in the past year, as seen in Figure 8:
 
Figure 8

It looks that it has been following an exponential rise in recent years and the current number of stations in the USA is over 43,000, meaning that they are growing at a rapid pace. This hopefully means once the EVTOL industry takes off it will have the same type of growth. Meanwhile, for Heliports the growth on a state-by-state basis has shown a decline in recent years, as seen in Figure 9:
 
Figure 9

The data from the years 1960-1984 were plotted using EXCEL’s line of best fit it was show in all cases to have growth growing linearly, but the actual number of Heliports now in 2021, were less than the expected amount. In most states, the number of Heliports in 1984 is more than the amount in 2021, meaning that most likely too many Heliports were built decades ago meaning that the supply and demand were not the same. This means when Vertiports are starting to be built for EVTOLs to make sure that not too many are built that they become not needed so the investments made are not lost. 

Recommendations
After looking at data, there are a few recommendations for OneSky in the VTOL and EVTOL industries. First off, for VTOL, OneSky should focus on longer trips as seen in Figures 2 and 6. The trips that are around 100-200 miles could easily be replaced with VTOLs instead using private jets. Also, there a lot of Heliports and flight routes in the western coast of USA, so it would make sense for OneSky to move VTOLs to places such as Los Angles, California and Las Vegas, Nevada. Next, for EVTOLs there are two spots in the USA that OneSky could place them to start in the new industry. The two spots are Los Angles, California and Manhattan, New York. Both spots would be beneficial because there are existing heliports and airports around those cities, meaning that air transportation could be used to into the city and get past the busy ground traffic. There are many EV Charging Stations that are garages and parking lots in those cities so it could allow the user to get around the city on the fly.
